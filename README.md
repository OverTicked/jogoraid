# jogoraid repo
a lightweight macro to grind jogo raid. (faster than tinytask)

open source, so easy to customize that you don't have to know code

don't forget to leave a _star_ if this worked nicely for you

## installation and setting up

- download [ahk v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/) → download → v1.1
- download `macrov#.#.#.ahk` file from [latest release](https://github.com/OverTicked/jogoraid/releases/latest) (at the bottom)
- run `macrov#.#.#.ahk`
- follow instructions on white text box following cursor

## something went wrong?
- for v1.2.1, if you dont see a white text box trailing your cursor, click [here](https://github.com/OverTicked/jogoraid/wiki)
- for pv1.3.8, no one will probably download that version until i wake up so lol
